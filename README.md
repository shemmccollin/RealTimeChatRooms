# RealTimeChatRooms
A scalable real-time chat room web application with dynamic chatrooms and user registration/login using JWT tokens. Created admin and user roles for admins to access the chatrooms and dashboard pages to create/view/edit/delete any channels, and for users to access the chatrooms page to join available chatroom channels and receive/send messages in real time. 

Utilized React as the frontend library along with HTML, CSS, TypeScript, SockJS and STOMPJS. 

Implemented the backend with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring MVC, Spring Data, Web Sockets, and MongoDB as the database.
